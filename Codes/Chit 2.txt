Here is the complete SQL DML code to address the 10 queries mentioned:

### Table Structure (Assumed)
Assuming we have an `EMP` table with the following columns:
- `ID` (Employee ID)
- `Name` (Employee Name)
- `Joining_date` (Date of Joining)
- `Salary` (Employee Salary)
- `Dept` (Department ID)

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMP (
    ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR2(50),
    Joining_date DATE,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Dept NUMBER(4)
);
```

### 1. Insert a Single Record into the Table:
```sql
-- Insert a single record into the EMP table
INSERT INTO EMP (ID, Name, Joining_date, Salary, Dept)
VALUES (101, 'Alice', TO_DATE('2023/01/15', 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 8500, 10);
```

### 2. Insert Multiple Rows into the Table:
```sql
-- Insert multiple rows into the EMP table
INSERT ALL
    INTO EMP (ID, Name, Joining_date, Salary, Dept) VALUES (102, 'Bob', TO_DATE('2023/03/20', 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 9500, 20)
    INTO EMP (ID, Name, Joining_date, Salary, Dept) VALUES (103, 'Charlie', TO_DATE('2023/06/10', 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 7800, 10)
    INTO EMP (ID, Name, Joining_date, Salary, Dept) VALUES (104, 'David', TO_DATE('2022/11/25', 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 8700, 30)
    INTO EMP (ID, Name, Joining_date, Salary, Dept) VALUES (105, 'Eva', TO_DATE('2023/07/10', 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 6500, 20)
SELECT * FROM dual;
```

### 3. Display All the Records from the Table:
```sql
-- Display all records from the EMP table
SELECT * FROM EMP;
```

### 4. Display All the Records Where Salary is Greater Than 8000:
```sql
-- Display records where Salary is greater than 8000
SELECT * FROM EMP
WHERE Salary > 8000;
```

### 5. Display Records in Ascending Order of Joining Date:
```sql
-- Display records sorted by Joining_date in ascending order
SELECT * FROM EMP
ORDER BY Joining_date ASC;
```

### 6. Update the Salary of Employee with ID = 100:
```sql
-- Update salary of employee with ID 100
UPDATE EMP
SET Salary = 50000
WHERE ID = 100;
```

### 7. Remove the Record of Employee with ID = 106:
```sql
-- Remove the record of employee with ID 106
DELETE FROM EMP
WHERE ID = 106;
```

### 8. Use DISTINCT Keyword to Display Salary of an Employee:
```sql
-- Display distinct salary values
SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM EMP;
```

### 9. Display the Minimum and Maximum Salary of an Employee:
```sql
-- Display the minimum and maximum salary of employees
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS Min_Salary, MAX(Salary) AS Max_Salary
FROM EMP;
```

### 10. Display the Total Number of Employees:
```sql
-- Display the total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees
FROM EMP;
```

### 11. Display the Sum of Salaries for Employees in Department 10:
```sql
-- Display the sum of salaries for employees in department 10
SELECT SUM(Salary) AS Total_Salary
FROM EMP
WHERE Dept = 10;
```

### Summary:
This set of queries covers various SQL DML operations:
1. Inserting records (`INSERT`).
2. Selecting records (`SELECT`).
3. Updating records (`UPDATE`).
4. Deleting records (`DELETE`).
5. Using aggregate functions like `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`.
6. Using `DISTINCT` to filter unique results.
7. Sorting results using `ORDER BY`.

Each query handles different aspects of working with the `EMP` table to manage employee data.
