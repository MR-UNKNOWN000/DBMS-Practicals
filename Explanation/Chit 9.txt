Chit No. 9: MongoDB – Aggregation and Indexing:
Design and Develop MongoDB Queries using aggregation and indexing with suitable example using MongoDB.


Here’s an algorithm that explains the step-by-step process of the MongoDB operations mentioned in your example, covering **Aggregation** and **Indexing**:

### **Algorithm for MongoDB Aggregation and Indexing**

#### **1. Setting Up the Database**

1. **Create a Database:**
   - Use the `use CompanyDB` command to create or switch to the `CompanyDB` database.

2. **Insert Sample Data:**
   - Insert multiple documents into the `Employees` collection with fields: `EmployeeID`, `Name`, `Age`, `Department`, and `Salary`.

#### **2. MongoDB Aggregation Operations**

##### **Example 1: Group Employees by Department**

1. **Aggregation Pipeline:**
   - Use `$group` to group documents by the `Department` field.
   - Calculate the **average salary** using the `$avg` operator.
   - Count the **total number of employees** per department using `$sum`.

2. **Result:** 
   - Each document in the result will contain:
     - `_id`: Department name.
     - `averageSalary`: The average salary of employees in that department.
     - `totalEmployees`: The total number of employees in that department.

##### **Example 2: Sort Employees by Salary**

1. **Aggregation Pipeline:**
   - Use `$sort` to sort documents by the `Salary` field in **descending** order (`-1`).

2. **Result:** 
   - Sorted list of employees, with the highest salary appearing first.

##### **Example 3: Filter Employees with Salary > 60000**

1. **Aggregation Pipeline:**
   - Use `$match` to filter employees where the `Salary` is greater than 60000.

2. **Result:** 
   - Documents containing employees whose salary is above 60000.

#### **3. MongoDB Indexing Operations**

##### **Example 1: Create Index on `Salary`**

1. **Index Creation:**
   - Use `db.Employees.createIndex({ Salary: 1 })` to create an **ascending** index on the `Salary` field.

2. **Effect:**
   - Speeds up queries that involve sorting or filtering based on `Salary`.

##### **Example 2: Create Compound Index on `Department` and `Salary`**

1. **Index Creation:**
   - Use `db.Employees.createIndex({ Department: 1, Salary: -1 })` to create a **compound index** on the `Department` field (ascending) and `Salary` field (descending).

2. **Effect:**
   - Optimizes queries that filter by `Department` and sort by `Salary`.

##### **Example 3: Verify Created Indexes**

1. **Index Verification:**
   - Use `db.Employees.getIndexes()` to list all indexes created on the `Employees` collection.

2. **Result:**
   - Lists the names of the indexes, such as `_id_`, `Salary_1`, and `Department_1_Salary_-1`.

### **Summary of Algorithm:**

1. **Aggregation Operations:**
   - **Group**: Aggregate data by grouping employees based on their department.
   - **Sort**: Sort employees based on salary.
   - **Filter**: Filter employees based on salary range.

2. **Indexing Operations:**
   - **Single Field Index**: Create an index on the `Salary` field to optimize queries.
   - **Compound Index**: Create a compound index on both `Department` and `Salary` to optimize multi-field queries.
   - **Index Verification**: Verify and list all indexes in the collection.

### **Performance Consideration:**

- **Aggregation** pipelines are computationally efficient for performing data transformations on the server side. They reduce the amount of data transferred from the server to the client.
- **Indexes** significantly improve query performance, especially for large datasets, by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate documents based on indexed fields.

By following this algorithm, MongoDB operations for **aggregation** and **indexing** can be applied to efficiently process and retrieve data from collections, especially when working with larger datasets.
